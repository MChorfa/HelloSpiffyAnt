[Hello Spiffy Ant](http://www.spiffyui.org) - beautiful, fast, maintainable applications with GWT and REST
==================================================

Hello Spiffy Ant is a sample application using the [Spiffy UI Framework](http://www.spiffyui.org) which builds a simple REST application with Apache Ant.


Building and Running Spiffy UI
--------------------------------------

Hello Spiffy Ant is built with [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) using [Apache Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/).  Once you've installed Ant go to your HelloSpiffyAnt working copy and run this command:

        <ANT HOME>/ant run
        
This will download Apache Ivy and the other the required libraries, build the Hello Spiffy Ant project, and run it with an embedded Jetty web server.  It will then provide instructions for accessing the running application once the build is completed.
