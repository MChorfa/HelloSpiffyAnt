[Hello Spiffy Ant](http://www.spiffyui.org) - beautiful, fast, maintainable applications with GWT and REST
==================================================

Hello Spiffy Ant is a sample application using the [Spiffy UI Framework](http://www.spiffyui.org) which builds a simple REST application with Apache Ant.


Building and Running Spiffy UI
--------------------------------------

HelloSpiffyREST is built with Apache Ant using Apache Ivy.  Once you've installed Ant with Ivy go to your HelloSpiffyREST working copy and run this command:

        <ANT HOME>/ant run
        
This will download the required libraries, build the Hello Spiffy Ant project, and run it with an embedded Jetty web server.  It will then provide intructions for accessing the running application once the build is completed.
