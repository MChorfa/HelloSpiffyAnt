The HelloSpiffyREST application is a simple example of using the Spiffy UI framework.


//
// Building and Running HelloSpiffyREST
//

HelloSpiffyREST is built with Apache Ant using Apache Ivy.  Once you've installed Ant
with Ivy go to your HelloSpiffyREST working copy and run this command:

        <ANT HOME>/ant run
        
This will download the required libraries, build the SPSample project, and run
it with an embedded web server.  It will then provide intructions for accessing
the running application.

Spiffy UI uses Apache ant with Apache Ivy to build.  If you have Apache Ant installed
without Apache Ivy you might see the following error:

    Problem: failed to create task or type antlib:org.apache.ivy.ant:settings
    
The solution is to make sure you are running the correct version of Ant by using
the full path to Ant like this:

        external/ant/bin/ant all run
        
If the problem persists you may need to set a system property to provide the path
to the correct version of Ant like this:

        export ANT_HOME=<full path to Spiffy UI>/spsample/external/ant
