The HelloSpiffyREST application is a simple example of using the Spiffy UI framework.


//
// Building and Running HelloSpiffyREST
//

HelloSpiffyREST is built with Apache Ant using Apache Ivy.  Once you've installed Ant
with Ivy go to your HelloSpiffyREST working copy and run this command:

        <ANT HOME>/ant run
        
This will download the required libraries, build the SPSample project, and run
it with an embedded web server.  It will then provide intructions for accessing
the running application.
